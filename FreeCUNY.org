* What is Free Software?
- Free Software is software that respects the users four basic freedoms
  1. The freedom to use the software how you like.
  2. The freedom study the source code and change it.
  3. The freedom to redistribute the program you received.
  4. The freedom to redistribute the as you have modified it.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
At the other end, "IP communists" object to copyright protection and
software patents, and even argue that software should be free. It is
regrettable, I believe, that the open access (OA) movement found
itself in the IP communist camp.
#+END_QUOTE

Moshe P. Vardi, Editor-in-Chief of Communication of ACM
** Equipment as a barrier to adoption
- lab spaces
- student laptops (economic gating)
** Maintenance problems
- necessity for admin rights
- computer labs are unusable
** partial solutions

* Reproducible research						     :export:

Reproducible research is the idea that scientific claims are published:
 - with their data 
 - software code used to analyze them

* Clarebout's principal						     :export:
#+Begin_quote
 An article about computational result is advertising, not
 scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment,
 code and data, that produced the result.
#+end_quote
Claerbout and Karrenbach, Proceedings of the 62nd Annual International Meeting of the Society of Exploration Geophysics. 1992

* Tie code to figure						     :export:
    
#+begin_quote
    When we publish articles containing figures which were generated
    by computer, we also publish the complete software environment
    which generates the figures
#+end_quote

  - definitions
  - current practice
  - tools 
  - changes to improve reproducibility and differentiate research

* Is /#Reproducibility/ a problem? 				     :export:

** Cancer research
   - In 2012, an Amgen team tried to reproduce important resutls
   - pre-clinical targets for cancer 
   - 47 out of 53 medical research papers 
   - were irreproducible

([[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7391/full/483531a.html]])

** Psychology
 -  Researchers explained in a 2006 study that, of 249 data sets from
    American Psychology Association (APA) empirical articles, 73% of
    contacted authors did not respond with their data over a 6-month
    period.

** Computer Science

Christian Collberg (http://reproducibility.cs.arizona.edu/v1/tr.pdf) looked 
at the papers in eight conferences and five ACM journals.  They were able 
to reproduce 102 out 613 papers 24.9%

   
** History of reproducible research
*** Mathematics
 - First proofs Greeks (ca. 400 B.C.E.)
   - Pythagoras (569–500 B.C.E.) proofs
   - Euclid of Alexandria (325 B.C.E.–265 B.C.E.) axioms and definitions
   - Eudoxus (408 B.C.E–355 B.C.E.) theorems
   - William of Occam (1288 C.E.–1348 C.E.) fewest steps
*** Advances in mathematics and proof
    - Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830) 
      - expansion of an arbitrary function into a trigonometric series
    - Evariste Galois (1812–1832) and Augustin Louis-Cauchy (1789–1857) 
      - abstract algebra by inventing group theory.
    - Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866) 
      - differential geometry, complex variable theory
    - Augustin-Louis Cauchy
      - partial differential equations
    - Carl Jacobi (1804–1851), Ernst Kummer (1810–1893), Niels Henrick Abel (1802–1829)
      - number theory

      - calculus of variations, classical mechanics, the implicit function theorem
    - Karl Weierstrass (1815–1897) 
      - real and complex analysis with numerous examples and proofs

*** Anti-replicatants
 - Gauss
   - inscrutible style
 - Bourbaki
   - Rejection of intuition of any kind
*** Gauss
#+Begin_quote
No self-respecting architect leaves the scaffolding in place after completing the building.
#+end_quote
attributed to Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777 C.E. - 1855 C.E.) in defense of his inscrutible style

*** Twentieth Century Contributions
#+Begin_quote
A proof is any completely convincing argument.
#+end_quote

E. Bishop, /Foundations of Constructive Analysis/, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1967.

** Experiments
 - Robert Grosseteste (c. 1175 C.E. –  1253 C.E.)
   - reasoned from universal to particular prediction
   - /Posterior Analytics/
 - Roger Bacon, (c. 1214 C.E. – 1294 C.E.)
   - observation, hypothesis, experimentation, and the need for independent verification. 
 - Galileo (1564 C.E. - 1642 C.E.),manufactured multiple /copies/ of his telescopes

** Org-mode solves three problems
(Kitchin, /Emacs, Org-mode + python reproducible research/, 2013)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-dUkyn_fZA

   - documents computation workflow
   - integrates text, math and code
   - produce or modifies a figure

** Org mode and Emacs
   - Emacs is written in a full programming language
   - understands LaTeX, markdown, language modes (R, Python, C, C++ and Java etc.)
   - can interact with OS
     - execute code
     - read the standard output
     - read the standard error (and insert into the buffer)

** Org-mode
   - note taking
   - TODO lists
   - differentiates between text, code and data
   - code executes in the buffer
   - enables links to files, urls
   - #+INCLUDE allows files to be broken into reusable pieces
   - exports available LaTeX, html, reveal.js etc.
